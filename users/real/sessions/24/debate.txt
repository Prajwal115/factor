Good evening, everyone. Opening Government has presented a case built on the idea of historical responsibility and while we understand the intuitive appeal of that argument, we in the Opposition believe it’s a dangerous oversimplification that ultimately hinders effective climate action. Their case, while well-intentioned, rests on shaky foundations and ignores the practical realities of tackling this global crisis.

Firstly, let’s address this idea of pure historical blame. While developed nations certainly industrialized first, to solely fixate on past emissions ignores the *current* and *future* emitters. Focusing only on historical guilt creates a perverse incentive for developing nations to continue polluting, arguing they have a 'right' to catch up. This creates a moral hazard. We need a global effort focused on *reducing future emissions*, not simply assigning blame for the past. What about China? Are we really suggesting they shouldn't shoulder significant responsibility simply because they industrialized later? The scale of their current emissions dwarfs many developed nations.

Secondly, the "polluter pays" principle, while superficially appealing, is incredibly difficult to implement fairly. How do we accurately calculate the exact cost of historical emissions attributable to each developed nation? What about the benefits those emissions provided to the global economy, including developing nations? This simplistic view fails to account for the complex, interconnected nature of the global economy.

Furthermore, let's talk about the practicality of relying solely on developed nations to fund climate action. While they possess significant resources, placing the *entire* financial burden on them is unrealistic and risks creating resentment and hindering international cooperation. We need *shared* responsibility, where all nations contribute according to their current capabilities and future impact. For example, incentivizing private sector investment and creating innovative financing mechanisms across all nations are critical.

Finally, we are not disputing that developed nations have a role to play, but framing it solely as a historical debt undermines the crucial need for a forward-looking, collaborative approach. We need a system that encourages *everyone* to invest in a sustainable future, not one that focuses solely on past transgressions. The issue isn't about saying “You broke it, you fix it” from the historical point of view, rather, “it’s broken, let's work together to fix it”. We therefore oppose this motion.

Following on from my leader, we in the Opposition bench want to further highlight why Opening Government's case is not only flawed, but actively damaging to the global effort to combat climate change. They paint a picture of developed nations as historical villains, solely responsible for the climate crisis, while portraying developing nations as helpless victims deserving of unending financial support. This is a gross oversimplification that prevents us from achieving real progress.

Firstly, let's delve deeper into the issue of *practicality*. Opening Government glosses over the logistical nightmare of implementing their proposal. How do you fairly distribute funds? Who decides which projects are worthy? What mechanisms are in place to prevent corruption and ensure the money is actually used effectively? Their plan opens the door to bureaucratic gridlock and inefficient spending, diverting resources away from truly impactful initiatives. We would much rather see that money invested into green tech, which can then be shared around the world.

Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition brought up a moral hazard. I'd like to dive into this further. Their emphasis on historical responsibility ignores the agency and responsibilities of developing nations *today*. By absolving them of significant financial obligations, they remove incentives for these nations to adopt sustainable development practices. Why invest in renewable energy when you can rely on developed nations to foot the bill? Why implement stricter environmental regulations when you know you'll receive compensation for any potential economic losses? This creates a system of dependency that ultimately hinders long-term sustainability.

Thirdly, Opening Government speaks of "climate justice," but their proposal actually risks creating *injustice*. Imagine a scenario where developed nations are forced to divert significant portions of their budgets to climate aid, potentially impacting their own citizens' access to essential services like healthcare and education. Is it truly just to punish current generations for the actions of their ancestors, especially when those actions also led to advancements that benefit the entire world? Their proposal risks creating resentment and division, further jeopardizing international cooperation.

Finally, consider the *innovation* aspect. Placing the financial burden solely on developed nations stifles innovation across the board. Developing nations lack the incentive to create their own sustainable solutions, while developed nations may be less motivated to invest in technologies that primarily benefit others. We need a system that fosters innovation globally, encouraging all nations to contribute their unique perspectives and resources to the fight against climate change.

In conclusion, Opening Government's simplistic and impractical proposal undermines the global effort to combat climate change. We need a system based on shared responsibility, innovation, and practical solutions, not one based on historical blame and unrealistic financial demands. We firmly oppose this motion.

So good evening to everybody present here. So we don't have all gathered here in the British Parliament. Tell about a very, very important topic. It's pretty interesting actually why this topic is being done here. Instead of the United Nations because I believe everybody should know, the world should know. But unfortunately we have some people like that in the opposition who are hindering progress. So the topic we are discussing today are delupinations to be held accountable from climate change. And by the way, if you think I'm being very less specific about the opposition, just wait until you hear me say what they planned when they were in power 10 years ago. And they were in power 10 years ago. That should be enough proof to indicate that the public has faded us and we are doing good actions. And it's so very weird to have a debate on this topic, I mean, which should not have even been debateable on this lake, but sure we are spent democracy. It's a democratic nation and we have been divided and hope to get important points from the opposition if they make violent points forced and hope to strengthen our policies and make the public and the world happy. So, delupination generally, they are way more prosperous, obviously, as enough. That's why they are well delupred. They are economically superior. They have a lot of money. But see, the thing is they are overwhelming the response more for cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere since the industry revolution. They are cutting down forests, their polluting rivers, and including our own. But the problem was not created overnight. It is a result of centuries of carbon intensive growth in their lot of economies and their lot of nations are suffering disproportionately from a problem they did not primarily cause. So, the delupinations they are really technologically superior and financially powerful compared to the deloping and under-delupinations. But see, suppose the delupination is using a forest land to set up an industry plant. Obviously, it's causing land pollution, water pollution, you name it, whatever it's causing. It's destroying the land, it's destroying the forest in a moment. But what are they doing? Those industry plants are generating ton of money, they are generating ton of profit. And what you are asking is to use some of that profit to try to eradicate and solve the problems they created in the first place. And somehow that appears to be very wrong for opposition, right? They think, oh no, the delupinations are not to be held accountable climate change. And that's why they are speaking against motion everybody. You're speaking for the motion, right? So that's the thing. They pollute a place based principle. We agree by that, that you create more and more of the damage you should bear the cost of free mediation. I mean, just like if you spread the garbage, you got to pick it up. Someone else is not going to do that for you, right? And climate change, unfortunately, is not just affecting the country which we are dealing with. It's affecting the world. Ireland's like Tualu and Nauru in the Pacific Ocean there on the right of Sink. And yet Japan as well, if we don't solve this climate problem in a while, I mean, we're not even in New York, might get underwater, right? So what's happening here is seed, otherwise, water, temperatures are rising, why? Because there's pollution, because there's greenhouse at why is that? Because the delupinations are overutilizing the resources. I'm not going to say, or I saw, I'm sorry, I said overutilizing, I should have said, or exploiting the resources. They are obviously there's, there are many problems linked to this, there's population growth and everything. But as delupinations with good technology in your disposal, you should be responsible for taking your actions, right? So I mean, they have not tried to limit the damage it causes. In fact, they're not even allocating enough money for that. The United States, for example. So according to United Nations, there is a policy which, I remember the back of my head, it says every country, it should try to have at least 33% of green color in the land area. But guess what, a US doesn't have that. So what it does, it requires land and fine countries, and then it says seed. So these are our 33% forest cover requirement. So if they have power and money to purchase, why not improve your own country, right? I mean, you're improving life of the citizens and perhaps the world. And knowing not doing that, it's a your acquiring land and probably destroying the land. Probably destroying the forest as well, right? But it's dust issue. Money with you don't spend. And somehow our position is inclined to that. They're saying, oh, we should not spend too much. You should not spend money at all in solving these problems. They are going to push us into climate change, UK's and Ireland. We might even sink because of them. And they have been in power, I don't know. They've been in power 10 years ago. And I'm class, they are not in power. Audience, you should note that policies, they don't care about the enrollment. They just care about the capitalism, the economy. Sure, they say, oh, this thing's not going to be having economic benefits from it. It's going to give economic benefits, my friend. If the enrollment is clean, which is going to be clean, if we reduce climate change and into short exploitation, if the enrollment is clean, you have a team area of, yeah, most of the policies are gone. So then you go to hospital less and, yeah, the stress and doctor's are reduced, obviously. But now you have more money in your pocket. And now you're going to spend more. You're going to improve the economy. So the thing is we have to look into proper ways before drawing conclusions. And I'll be ready. We're not drawing conclusions. We're not finding fingers as anybody. If we find crucial points for the debate, which we hope to find, we will surely implement them in our policies. But I just have to say this one last time, opposition had not done enough when they were in power. And how can they assure us the government and the public that they will do it this time? The right way. When they are opposing this very nation, very emotion of the climate change. Over to you, media opposition. Thank you.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening everyone. I must confess, listening to the Prime Minister’s speech was quite the experience. A meandering, rambling monologue filled with personal attacks, historical inaccuracies, and a complete misunderstanding of the complexities of climate change policy. If that’s the best Opening Government can offer, then I am confident this motion will be defeated soundly.

Let's dissect the Prime Minister's arguments, shall we? First, they accuse us of "hindering progress." But what progress are they actually proposing? A simplistic, blame-based system that punishes developed nations for past actions, regardless of the current global context. This isn't progress; it's a recipe for resentment and inaction. They act like the topic shouldn't even be debatable, when in reality it's an incredibly complex issue that requires nuanced solutions.

They then trot out the well-worn trope of developed nations "exploiting" resources and "polluting" the world. Of course, developed nations have contributed significantly to historical emissions. We acknowledge that. But the PM conveniently ignores the fact that many developing nations are now rapidly increasing their own emissions as they industrialize and grow their economies. Are these emissions somehow less harmful? Should we ignore them simply because they come from developing nations? This hypocrisy undermines the entire argument for global cooperation.

The Prime Minister seems to believe that simply throwing money at the problem will solve everything. They cite the "polluter pays" principle, conveniently ignoring the immense practical challenges of determining historical liability and fairly distributing funds. They offer vague pronouncements about developed nations using profits to "eradicate" problems, but provide no concrete plans or mechanisms for achieving this. It's pure rhetoric, devoid of substance.

The PM then launches into a bizarre tangent about land usage in the United States, claiming they "acquire land in other countries" instead of improving their own. This is not only inaccurate but completely irrelevant to the core issue of climate finance. It's a desperate attempt to distract from the flaws in their own argument. They say we care only about capitalism and the economy, ignoring the immense investment in green technology, renewable energy, and sustainable development made by many developed nations. We simply believe that a strong economy is *essential* for funding effective climate action. You cannot redistribute wealth that doesn't exist.

Finally, the Prime Minister engages in ad hominem attacks, criticizing our party's past record. This is a classic debating tactic when you have no real arguments to offer. The past is the past. We are here to debate the merits of *this* motion, not rehash old political grievances.

In conclusion, Opening Government's case is based on simplistic blame, impractical solutions, and a complete disregard for the complex realities of climate change. They offer no viable plan for achieving meaningful progress and instead resort to personal attacks and historical inaccuracies. We, in the Opposition, stand firmly against this motion and will continue to advocate for a balanced, collaborative, and effective approach to tackling this global challenge.


===== deputy leader of opp. =====
Wow, oh my gosh, you just proved my points that the opposition does not care. So as Prime Minister stated, objective is to make sure the climate change eradicated its source. But it looks like you don't check your facts, leader of opposition respectfully, China is a deadlock nation. Right. I mean, if you have checked the HDI even on Wikipedia, you would know that, right? But the thing is, you said, I know you are a guy of collaboration. I appreciate that. I respect that. But how are you going to convince other countries, like the developing countries and the developed countries to allocate the fund to solve this problem if they're not even responsible? I mean, why would they even do that? I mean, you have a lot of money. At least there is 1% of that money to solve the ill-effet you have created. And wow, you said emissions are having positive benefits. I mean, have I, like, I don't know. I just can't believe it, audience. They say carbon emissions are good. It's very common. Oh my God. I mean, sure. If you're a capitalistic person, sure. But as prime minister stated, this plan that we are doing, it is also economically feasible and more long term for the greater good. Capitalistic greed is not value health. The V value health and we have to fix everything. Now sure, there's financial burden on the developed nations. At least some of them are in debt, you can say. But that does not necessarily mean that you're going to take money from the poor nations for things they were not responsible. Right? I mean, in diplomacy, even if you're being diplomatic, you should probably just probably stay away, right? If it's not your problem, if it's not affecting you and your country. Then why should they care? How would you even tell them to care? I mean, sure, you would give them the entire document of what's going to happen to Earth and stuff like that. But no, they can't contribute. Even if they can't contribute because they're under developed nations, they're developing nations, they simply can't because of financial constraints. We do have a serious responsibility. Yes, we do. I agree for once with the opposition. That's why we wanted this discussion in the United Nations. So that we can call out the nations and hold them accountable for their actions. But now, here we have been caught, grilled by the opposition for doing something good for everybody else. And wow, you're telling me that we are stuck in the past. We are backward. We are focusing on history and on the present. No, that's simply not right. In fact, we can literally say that same thing for you. I mean, in the last 10 years, we have been so many great things. We have implemented a lot of phenomena to loss a lot of protection. As far as we have increased the forest, covered by 20%. But what did you do when you were in power in the 10 years ago? You did nothing except for maybe a few benefits for your capitalistic friends, respectfully, and in your native opposition. But yes, we are not trying to blame everybody. We are just trying to lay a simple foundation. You're responsible. Do it. Solve it. Right. Sure, you can ask people to contribute what they can. You can have a go fund me kind of thing where you can donate from anywhere between zero dollars to, you know, maximum amount. But you can't force everybody to pay the same amount. That is very, very bad. It's very root for the interest of other developing and underdeveloped nations. Because why should they care about the mess they make when the industrial nations are sitting on tons of profits? And I guess the opposition leader is towards the side of capitalism rather than the side of environment and greater good. And that explains why his party did not do great actions when it was in power. And that's the reason why we are still in power. And that's why the public is faith in us. But yeah, let's have a wonderful debate. And I hope to learn if it's learnable. But we're not creating a historical guilt. We are just doing. You did that. Fix it. You spread the garbage. Pick it up. Right. That's the simple analogy. I don't know why the opposition called an astonished. Or maybe they are just having some politic thing to do with these capitalistic schemes. I don't know. We'll find that out in the debate. But yes, over to you, a deputy leader of opposition.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening. Following that performance, I think it's clear Opening Government is flailing. The Deputy Prime Minister's speech was riddled with inaccuracies, personal attacks, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues at hand. Instead of addressing the substance of our arguments, they resorted to misrepresentation and outright falsehoods.

Let's begin with the central claim that China is a "developed nation." This is demonstrably false. While China has experienced significant economic growth, it still faces significant challenges, including widespread poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. To classify China as a developed nation is not only inaccurate but also ignores the reality of its ongoing development needs. The PM's reliance on the Human Development Index (HDI) demonstrates a superficial understanding of complex development indicators. HDI is not the be-all-end-all.

Furthermore, the Deputy Prime Minister completely misrepresented our position on emissions. We never said that emissions are "good." That is a blatant fabrication. What we *did* say is that focusing solely on historical emissions ignores the current and future emissions from *all* nations, including developing ones. We need a global solution, not a blame game. To suggest we are pro-pollution is disingenuous and frankly, insulting.

The Deputy Prime Minister asks how we can convince developing nations to contribute to climate action if they are not responsible. The answer is simple: by appealing to their self-interest and by offering them incentives to adopt sustainable development practices. Developing nations are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, so it is in their best interest to participate in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to these impacts. Furthermore, developed nations can provide financial and technological assistance to help developing nations transition to cleaner energy sources and more sustainable economies. The key is collaboration and mutual benefit, not guilt-tripping and financial coercion.

The Deputy Prime Minister claims that we are "stuck in the past," yet they themselves are fixated on historical emissions and past wrongdoings. We are focused on the *future*, on building a sustainable global economy that benefits all nations. They accuse us of favoring "capitalistic schemes," ignoring the fact that many innovative climate solutions are being developed and deployed by the private sector. The DPM's portrayal of us as uncaring capitalists is a tired and inaccurate caricature.

Finally, the Deputy Prime Minister resorts to personal attacks, criticizing our party's past record. This is a desperate attempt to distract from the weakness of their own arguments. We are not here to defend our past actions; we are here to debate the merits of *this* motion. The fact that they feel the need to attack us personally suggests that they are losing the argument.

In conclusion, Opening Government's case is based on misrepresentation, distortion, and personal attacks. They have failed to offer a coherent and practical plan for addressing climate change, and they have resorted to demonizing those who disagree with them. We, in the Opposition, remain firmly committed to a balanced, collaborative, and effective approach to tackling this global challenge. We urge you to reject this flawed and divisive motion.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening. We've heard a lot from the Opposition tonight, and frankly, their arguments reek of deflection and a refusal to acknowledge the fundamental injustice at the heart of the climate crisis. They've nitpicked our plan, misrepresented our points, and generally avoided the core issue: developed nations bear a disproportionate responsibility for climate change and therefore should bear the primary financial responsibility for addressing it.

The Opposition keeps hammering on about the "practicality" of our proposal. They ask, "How do you distribute funds fairly? How do you prevent corruption?" These are important questions, and we are prepared to answer them. However, let's be clear: the *existence* of logistical challenges does not negate the *moral imperative* to act. We can and must find ways to overcome these challenges. International organizations like the UN already have mechanisms in place for distributing aid and monitoring its use. We can strengthen these mechanisms and develop new ones to ensure that funds are used effectively and transparently. But to say that we shouldn't even *try* because it might be difficult is simply unacceptable.

They also raise the specter of a "moral hazard," claiming that holding developed nations accountable will disincentivize developing nations from taking action. This is a patronizing and frankly offensive argument. Developing nations are not children who need to be bribed into doing the right thing. They are sovereign nations with their own interests and priorities. They are already suffering disproportionately from the impacts of climate change, and they have every incentive to participate in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to these impacts. Providing them with financial assistance is not about removing their responsibility; it's about empowering them to take action without sacrificing their own economic development. It's about ensuring they don't have to choose between feeding their people and protecting the planet.

The Opposition talks about "shared responsibility," but what does that really mean in practice? Does it mean that the small island nations facing imminent sea-level rise should contribute the same amount as wealthy, industrialized nations? Does it mean that developing nations struggling with poverty and disease should divert scarce resources away from essential services to fund climate action? Of course not. Shared responsibility must be proportional to capacity and historical responsibility. Developed nations, having benefited from centuries of carbon-intensive growth, have a greater capacity to pay and a greater moral obligation to do so.

Finally, they accuse us of focusing on the past instead of the future. But the past is not irrelevant. It is the foundation upon which the present is built. The accumulated emissions of developed nations are the primary cause of the climate crisis we face today. To ignore this historical reality is to ignore the fundamental injustice of the situation. We are not simply assigning blame; we are recognizing the historical context that shapes the present and that demands a just and equitable solution.

We acknowledge that addressing climate change is a complex challenge. There are no easy answers, and there will be obstacles along the way. But we cannot allow these challenges to paralyze us. We must act, and we must act now. Holding developed nations accountable is not just a matter of justice; it is a matter of survival. We urge you to support this motion.

Good evening. Listening to the Member of Government, it's clear they are committed to a narrative of historical guilt and financial reparations, ignoring the very real consequences of their proposal. While they try to paint us as heartless and uncaring, we are simply pointing out the flaws in a plan that, while perhaps well-intentioned, is ultimately impractical and counterproductive.

The MG dismissed our concerns about practicality, saying the existence of logistical challenges doesn't negate the moral imperative to act. Of course, we agree that action is needed. But action without a sound plan is simply performative. They claim existing international organizations can handle the distribution of funds, but these organizations are already struggling with bureaucracy, corruption, and a lack of accountability. Simply throwing more money at the problem without addressing these underlying issues will only exacerbate the problem. We need concrete plans for ensuring funds are used effectively, not vague assurances.

They also dismissed our concerns about moral hazard, arguing that developing nations are not children who need to be bribed. But the reality is that economic incentives matter. If developing nations know they can rely on developed nations to foot the bill for climate action, they will have less incentive to invest in sustainable development themselves. This isn't about "bribing" them; it's about creating a system where everyone has a stake in the outcome and everyone is incentivized to act responsibly.

The MG claims that shared responsibility must be proportional to capacity and historical responsibility. But how do you accurately measure capacity and historical responsibility? How do you account for the benefits that developing nations have received from the industrialization of developed nations? How do you ensure that developed nations are not unfairly burdened with the costs of addressing climate change? Their proposal is based on a simplistic and ultimately unworkable formula.

Furthermore, the MG's focus on historical guilt ignores the reality that many developing nations are now rapidly industrializing and increasing their own emissions. Are they somehow exempt from responsibility simply because they industrialized later? This double standard undermines the entire argument for global cooperation. We need a system where everyone is held accountable for their *current* and *future* emissions, regardless of their historical track record.

Finally, the MG accuses us of ignoring the historical context of climate change. But we are not ignoring history; we are simply recognizing that the past is the past and that we cannot change it. What we *can* change is the future. We need to focus on developing innovative solutions that will reduce emissions globally and help all nations adapt to the impacts of climate change. We need to foster collaboration and mutual benefit, not division and resentment.

The government's proposal, while presented as a matter of justice, is ultimately a recipe for disaster. It will create resentment, stifle innovation, and ultimately undermine the global effort to combat climate change. We urge you to reject this flawed and impractical motion.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening. As the last speaker for the Opposition, I want to reiterate the core flaws in the Government’s case and highlight the real-world dangers of their proposed policy. They cling to historical responsibility as their guiding principle, a principle that sounds appealing in theory but crumbles under the weight of practical application and unintended consequences.

Firstly, let's address this persistent idea of a clear-cut historical debt. It ignores the globalised nature of development. Were only *developed* nations benefiting from the Industrial Revolution? The resources, raw materials, and labor that fueled that growth came from all over the world, including what are now developing nations. To pretend these nations were simply passive victims is a gross mischaracterization of history. Many actively participated in and benefited from global trade networks. Therefore, assigning blame and financial responsibility solely to developed nations is an inaccurate and unfair assessment of the past.

Secondly, the Government has failed to provide any credible mechanism for ensuring funds are used effectively and transparently. Simply stating that “international organizations” can handle it is woefully inadequate. We’ve seen time and time again how aid money can be siphoned off by corrupt officials, wasted on ineffective projects, or used to advance political agendas. Without robust safeguards and accountability measures, the Government’s plan risks becoming a massive boondoggle, enriching a few while doing little to address the climate crisis.

Thirdly, let's consider the opportunity cost. By forcing developed nations to divert vast sums of money to climate aid, the Government is potentially depriving them of resources they could use to invest in innovation, infrastructure, and other areas that would benefit the entire world. Imagine if that money was instead used to develop breakthrough technologies in renewable energy or carbon capture. These technologies could then be shared with developing nations, allowing them to leapfrog the carbon-intensive development path and build sustainable economies from the ground up. The Government’s narrow focus on financial transfers ignores the immense potential for technological solutions.

Finally, the most dangerous consequence of the Government’s proposal is that it creates division and resentment. By portraying developed nations as historical villains and developing nations as perpetual victims, they are poisoning the well of international cooperation. Climate change is a global problem that requires global solutions. We need all nations to work together, not to be at each other’s throats. The Government’s divisive rhetoric undermines the very cooperation that is essential for tackling this challenge.

For these reasons, we believe the Government's motion is deeply flawed and ultimately counterproductive. We urge you to reject it and embrace a more balanced, collaborative, and forward-looking approach to addressing climate change. Let's focus on solutions, not blame. Let’s build a sustainable future together.


===== leader of opposition =====


===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening, everyone. We in the Opposition have consistently demonstrated throughout this debate that Opening Government’s singular focus on historical responsibility is a flawed and ultimately damaging approach to tackling climate change. Their case rests on shaky moral ground, ignores practical realities, and actively hinders the kind of global cooperation we desperately need.

The central problem with the Government's argument is its simplistic view of history. As my colleagues have pointed out, the Industrial Revolution, while originating in developed nations, was a global phenomenon that benefited, and was fueled by, resources and labor from across the world. To isolate developed nations as the sole villains ignores the complex interplay of global economies and trade.

Furthermore, their relentless emphasis on financial reparations distracts from the urgent need for innovation and technological solutions. Instead of focusing on transferring wealth, we should be investing in research and development of clean energy technologies, sustainable agriculture, and carbon capture techniques. These innovations, if shared globally, could provide a far more effective and sustainable solution to climate change than simply writing checks. Their plan is looking backwards, ours looks forward.

The Government has consistently failed to address the practical challenges of their proposal. How do we fairly and effectively distribute funds? How do we prevent corruption and ensure accountability? How do we incentivize developing nations to embrace sustainable development practices? They offer vague assurances and rely on existing international organizations, which, as we have pointed out, are often plagued by inefficiency and bureaucracy.

But perhaps the most concerning aspect of the Government's case is its divisive rhetoric. By constantly emphasizing historical guilt and portraying developed nations as exploiters and developing nations as victims, they are creating a climate of resentment and mistrust. This makes it far more difficult to build the global consensus needed to address climate change effectively. Why would a developed nation be enthusiastic about providing assistance if they are constantly being demonized and accused of historical crimes?

The Prime Minister may talk about the moral high ground, but their policy will lead to very real world problems. Their focus on "making countries pay" simply ignores the impact on local people in developed countries too. The cost of green policies, and this payment, will be put onto ordinary people, with higher taxes, reduced services, and job losses. This isn't fair to them, and will only breed resentment.

We believe there is a better way. A way that focuses on collaboration, innovation, and shared responsibility. A way that recognizes the complex realities of the global economy and the urgent need for effective solutions. We need to incentivize all nations to reduce emissions, invest in sustainable development, and protect our planet. We need to build trust and foster cooperation, not sow division and resentment.

Therefore, we in the Opposition stand firmly against this motion. We believe it is a flawed, impractical, and ultimately counterproductive approach to addressing climate change. We urge you to reject it and embrace a more balanced and effective solution.


===== leader of opposition =====
So good evening to everybody present here. This is the prime minister speaking. So here we are to discuss the debate, which is really surprised why opposition is even opposing this motion because this debate debate deserves to be in the United Nations. Are there any other nations to be held accountable for climate change? Yes, I mean why not? If you spread the garbage, we did not pick it up. And I respectfully add in a while, the leader of opposition is opposing all this because when they were in power there in power 10 years, they did not do any great policies regarding climate change like we have done. And that's the reason why we haven't been par with for the last 10 days. The government, the public believes in the government, but that's what the opposition doesn't know why they've been doing this debate in first place. They're against the environment, they're against the greater good, they're against our policies and I don't know why they're against. Maybe they are favoring their capitalistic friends or businesses or maybe they're willing some money value or human life. And again, why not as well? They'd rather want the island to sink. I mean, islands like Tualu and Noru, the pacific, they are the words of sinking, but the opposition doesn't care. They are here, resting time, debating us on a rare official topic. But now, okay, this is a democracy, right? We are here for learning, so I hope to learn some things from these debates and hopefully implement them in our policies. Over to you, leader of opposition.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening. The Prime Minister's closing remarks were, unfortunately, more of the same: a collection of unsubstantiated accusations, personal attacks, and a continued avoidance of the real issues at stake. Their reliance on tired rhetoric and ad hominem attacks only underscores the weakness of their case.

The Prime Minister begins by stating their surprise that we are opposing this motion. It seems they are truly unwilling to consider any perspective other than their own, blinded by a self-righteous certainty that prevents them from engaging in meaningful debate. We are opposing this motion not because we are "against the environment" or "favoring capitalistic friends," but because we believe it is a deeply flawed and ultimately counterproductive approach to tackling climate change. We care about the environment, and we believe there are more effective ways to protect it.

The Prime Minister then repeats the tired accusation that our party failed to address climate change effectively when we were in power. This is a convenient distraction from the shortcomings of their own proposal. We are not here to defend our past record; we are here to debate the merits of *this* motion. The Prime Minister's constant reliance on historical grievances only demonstrates their inability to defend their own policies on their own merits.

They accuse us of "wanting islands to sink," a frankly absurd and offensive claim. We are deeply concerned about the impacts of climate change on vulnerable nations, but we believe that the Government's proposal is not the solution. Instead of offering real help to these nations, it provides a false promise based on simplistic blame and impractical financial transfers. It's a smokescreen that allows developed nations to feel good about themselves without actually addressing the root causes of the problem.

The Prime Minister claims they are "here for learning," but their actions suggest otherwise. They have consistently dismissed our concerns, misrepresented our arguments, and resorted to personal attacks. This is not the behavior of someone who is genuinely interested in learning and engaging in constructive dialogue. It is the behavior of someone who is more interested in scoring political points than in finding real solutions.

The core problem with the Government's case remains their unwavering focus on historical responsibility. This principle, while seemingly appealing, is impractical, divisive, and ultimately counterproductive. It ignores the complex realities of the global economy, the urgent need for innovation, and the importance of global cooperation.

Their policy will punish ordinary citizens in developed countries. The burden of massive wealth transfers will fall on taxpayers, leading to higher taxes, reduced services, and slower economic growth. Is that a just outcome?

We in the Opposition remain committed to a more balanced and effective approach to addressing climate change. An approach that focuses on innovation, collaboration, and shared responsibility. An approach that recognizes the complexities of the problem and the need for practical solutions. An approach that unites nations instead of dividing them.

We urge you to reject this flawed motion and embrace a more realistic and effective path forward. Thank you.

===== Opening Opp =====
Good evening. Tonight, we, as the opposition, have consistently presented a measured, pragmatic, and future-oriented approach to addressing climate change. In stark contrast, Opening Government has clung steadfastly to a narrative of historical responsibility, a narrative that, while emotionally resonant, is ultimately unsustainable, impractical, and potentially detrimental to global cooperation.

The fundamental flaw in the government's argument is its oversimplified portrayal of history. They paint a picture of developed nations as villains solely responsible for the climate crisis, conveniently ignoring the complex and interconnected nature of global development. The industrial revolution, while originating in specific nations, had worldwide implications, drawing resources and labor from all corners of the globe. Attributing blame solely to developed nations ignores the historical agency and participation of developing nations in this process.

Moreover, the government's singular focus on financial reparations fails to acknowledge the power of innovation and technological advancements. While financial assistance is undoubtedly important, it is not the sole solution to climate change. Investing in research and development of clean energy technologies, sustainable agriculture practices, and carbon capture methods offers a far more effective and long-term strategy for mitigating the effects of climate change and transitioning to a sustainable future.

Throughout this debate, we have raised serious concerns about the practicality and feasibility of the government's proposed policy. How will funds be distributed fairly and efficiently? What mechanisms will be put in place to prevent corruption and ensure accountability? The government has failed to provide concrete answers to these questions, relying instead on vague assurances and platitudes.

However, the most troubling aspect of the government's argument is its potential to sow discord and undermine global cooperation. By constantly emphasizing historical guilt and portraying developed nations as owing reparations to developing nations, they risk creating a climate of resentment and mistrust. Addressing climate change requires a united front, a collective effort by all nations to reduce emissions and transition to a sustainable future. The government's divisive rhetoric threatens to unravel this vital cooperation.

Their policy is not a matter of justice, it's a matter of political point scoring. If implemented, many ordinary people in developed countries will suffer. The financial burden would fall on taxpayers, resulting in increased taxes, cuts to essential services, and hindering economic growth. The government forgets that many developed countries are still dealing with the fallout from a global recession, they should be focusing on getting their economies back on track, and helping their citizens, not punishing them.

As such, we firmly oppose this motion. It is a flawed, impractical, and ultimately counterproductive approach to addressing climate change. We urge you to reject this divisive rhetoric and embrace a more balanced, collaborative, and forward-looking approach that unites nations in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Thank you.

Good evening everyone, this is the prime minister speaking. So yeah, today we are here to talk about if the deliberations are to be held accountable climate change. Yes, the answer is yes. I don't know why the opposition is even happening. It's to be disdivated. It's to be the United Nations so that we can call upon those nations which I'm not doing enough to solve the problems they created in the first place. I mean, you're going to pick up the garbage you created, right? But the opposition doesn't want that. They want to benefit themselves. They want the money. They want the people. They want the powerful people. They don't want the good thing for the wildlife, the general public and the world. They rather want the island like Toalu in the best of the sink. Then to lose a load of profit.

Good evening, everyone. The Prime Minister's closing statement, sadly, offers nothing new. We are once again subjected to simplistic accusations, personal attacks, and a blatant disregard for the complexities of the climate crisis. Their persistent reliance on such tactics underscores the fundamental weakness of their position.

The core argument of the Government rests on the premise of historical responsibility, claiming developed nations should be held accountable for the problems they created. While this may sound morally appealing, it ignores the intertwined nature of global development. The growth of developed nations was often inextricably linked to resources and labor from now-developing nations. Holding one side solely responsible for past actions oversimplifies a far more nuanced reality.

The Prime Minister repeatedly accuses us of wanting to "benefit ourselves," of prioritizing "money" and "powerful people" over the "general public" and "wildlife." This is a completely unfounded and frankly insulting characterization of our position. We oppose this motion because we believe it is a misguided and ineffective approach to tackling climate change. We care deeply about protecting the environment and ensuring a sustainable future for all, but we believe that the Government's plan is simply not the best way to achieve these goals.

We've continuously questioned the feasibility and practicality of the Government's proposed policy. How will funds be distributed fairly and effectively? What safeguards will be put in place to prevent corruption? How will we guarantee accountability? The government has failed to provide satisfactory answers, relying instead on vague assurances and idealistic pronouncements.

They say "you're going to pick up the garbage you created, right?", failing to grasp how hard it is to accurately trace what "garbage" comes from who, and how damaging it is to simply focus on cleaning up past messes rather than ensuring nobody continues to pollute.

Furthermore, the Government’s persistent use of divisive language is deeply concerning. By framing the issue as a conflict between developed and developing nations, they are actively undermining the global cooperation that is essential for addressing climate change effectively. Building a sustainable future requires all nations to work together, not to be pitted against each other in a blame game.

Their policy is not about seeking climate justice; it is, simply, virtue signaling. The consequences of this plan will disproportionately affect working-class people in developed countries, through job losses in key industries, and higher tax burdens. The reality is, they are willing to pass the burden of historical emissions onto those that can least afford it, so they can look good.

We, as the opposition, propose a far more practical and effective solution: promoting collaboration, fostering innovation, and investing in sustainable development practices. We believe that by working together, we can create a future where both developed and developing nations can thrive while protecting the planet for future generations. Therefore, we resolutely oppose this motion.
